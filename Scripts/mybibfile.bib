abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Changes in climate projected for the 21{\textless}sup{\textgreater}st{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} century are expected to trigger widespread and pervasive biotic impacts. Forecasting these changes and their implications for ecosystem services is a major research goal. Much of the research on biotic responses to climate change has focused on either projected shifts in individual species distributions or broad-scale changes in biome distributions. Here, we introduce a novel application of multinomial logistic regression as a powerful approach to model vegetation distributions and potential responses to 21{\textless}sup{\textgreater}st{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} century climate change. We modeled the distribution of 22 major vegetation types, most defined by a single dominant woody species, across the San Francisco Bay Area. Predictor variables included climate and topographic variables. The novel aspect of our model is the output: a vector of relative probabilities for each vegetation type in each location within the study domain. The model was then projected for 54 future climate scenarios, spanning a representative range of temperature and precipitation projections from the CMIP3 and CMIP5 ensembles. We found that sensitivity of vegetation to climate change is highly heterogeneous across the region. Surprisingly, sensitivity to climate change is higher closer to the coast, on lower insolation, north-facing slopes and in areas of higher precipitation. While such sites may provide refugia for mesic and cool-adapted vegetation in the face of a warming climate, the model suggests they will still be highly dynamic and relatively sensitive to climate-driven vegetation transitions. The greater sensitivity of moist and low insolation sites is an unexpected outcome that challenges views on the location and stability of climate refugia. Projections provide a foundation for conservation planning and land management, and highlight the need for a greater understanding of the mechanisms and time scales of potential climate-driven vegetation transitions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = "No-till management has rapidly increased the cultivated area in Brazil. To control soil acidity in no-till systems, lime is broadcast on the surface without incorporation. The effectiveness of surface application of lime to soils under a no-till system, particularly with regard to subsoil acidity, is uncertain. Crop root growth and grain yield can be affected by chemical modifications in the soil profile due to surface lime application. A 3-year field trial examined the effect of newly and previously surface-applied lime in a long-term no-till system on the root growth and crop yield of corn (Zea mays L.), soybean (Glycine max L. Merrill), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) on a loamy, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Hapludox in Paraná State, Brazil. The experiment consisted of four lime treatments: (i) no lime (control); (ii) liming at 3tha−1 in 2000; (iii) liming at 6tha−1 in 1993; (iv) liming in 1993 and re-liming in 2000. Corn was grown in 2000–2001 and soybeans were grown in 2001–2002 and 2002–2003 without rainfall limitation. Wheat was grown in 2003 with a water deficit during the vegetative stage and soon after flowering. Liming in 2000 increased pH and the content of exchangeable Ca2+, and decreased the exchangeable Al3+ level mainly in the surface layer of the soil (0–5cm). Compared with the no lime control, liming in 1993 ameliorated soil acidity and decreased aluminum toxicity to a 60cm depth. Liming in 2000 on the previously limed plots compared with the liming in 1993 increased pH to a 10cm depth about 1 year after application and to a 60cm depth 3 years after application, indicating that the surface-applied lime in 2000 moved deeper when the topsoil was only slightly acidic. Root length density and grain yields of corn and soybean were not influenced by surface liming treatments. Liming in 2000 on the previously limed plots provided increases ≥100% in length density of wheat roots at 0–10 and 10–20cm depths, and increased the wheat grain yield by over 210%. A soil exchangeable Al3+ level of 3mmol(+)dm−3 was considered critical for wheat root growth. Wheat grain yield was well correlated with root length per soil surface area. The results suggest that aluminum toxicity is low in no-till systems during cropping seasons that have adequate and well-distributed rainfall, but in unfavorable rainfall conditions, the toxicity of aluminum severely compromises root growth and yield."

	abstract = {Efforts to anticipate how climate change will affect future food availability can benefit from understanding the impacts of changes to date. We found that in the cropping regions and growing seasons of most countries, with the important exception of the United States, temperature trends from 1980 to 2008 exceeded one standard deviation of historic year-to-year variability. Models that link yields of the four largest commodity crops to weather indicate that global maize and wheat production declined by 3.8 and 5.5\%, respectively, relative to a counterfactual without climate trends. For soybeans and rice, winners and losers largely balanced out. Climate trends were large enough in some countries to offset a significant portion of the increases in average yields that arose from technology, carbon dioxide fertilization, and other factors.},
